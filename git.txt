What is Git?

Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

It allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously, tracks changes, and lets you revert to previous versions if needed.

Basic Git Commands:

1. git init
   Initializes a new Git repository in the current folder.

2. git clone <repository-url>
   Clones an existing GitHub repository to your local system.

3. git status
   Shows the current status of changes in your working directory.

4. git add <filename>
   Stages the file for the next commit.

5. git commit -m "Your commit message"
   Saves the changes to the local repository.

6. git push origin <branch-name>
   Uploads your local changes to the remote GitHub repository.

7. git pull
   Fetches and merges changes from the remote repository.

8. git branch
   Lists all branches or creates a new one.

9. git checkout <branch-name>
   Switches to a different branch.

10. git merge <branch-name>
    Merges another branch into your current one.

Git is the foundation of collaboration in software development. It enables teams to build, test, and ship code quickly and safely.
